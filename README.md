# Applications-of-Graph-Convolutional-Networks-in-Mobility-and-Urban-Planning
In this project I would like to showcase the capabilities of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) in Mobility related Machine Learning problems. This short tutorial will introduce the key principles of Mobility Data Science and demonstrate the applications of GCNs on such Datasets.
